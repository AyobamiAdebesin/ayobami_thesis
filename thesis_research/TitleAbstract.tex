	This thesis investigates the application of the spectral transformation Lanczos (ST-Lanczos) algorithm to a dense symmetric-definite generalized eigenvalue problem of the form $Av = \lambda Bv$ where $A$ and $B$ are dense, real symmetric matrices with $B$ being positive definite and possibly, ill-conditioned. The Lanczos algorithm is a well-known iterative algorithm for computing the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix and it works well if the spectrum of the eigenvalues are well-spaced. By leveraging a shifted and inverted formulation of the problem, the ST-Lanczos algorithm relies on iterative projection to approximate extremal eigenvalues near a shift $\sigma$. While previous work has been done in using ST-Lanczos for sparse problems, we adapt this technique to dense problems and analyze how the error bounds already proven for direct methods plays out in an iterative context.\\[10pt]
	This study primarily focuses on benchmarking the ST-Lanczos method against established direct methods in the literature and addresses challenges in numerical stability, computational efficiency, and sensitivity of residuals to ill-conditioning.
