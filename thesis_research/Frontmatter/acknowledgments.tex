First and foremost, I express my profound gratitude to God for the gift of life, grace and opportunity bestowed onto me for bringing me this far in life and helping me complete another step towards achieving my dreams.

I would also like to express my deepest gratitude to my thesis advisor, Professor Michael Stewart for his unwavering support, guidance and impact on the completion of this thesis. I had absolutely zero knowledge or idea on this subject before starting this thesis, but his expertise, patience and insightful feedback have been invaluable in shaping this thesis and my growth as a mathematician. It is such a great privilege to have had the opportunity to learn from you. God bless you sir.

Additionally, I would also like to extend my sincere appreciation to the members of my committee, Professor Russell Jeter, and Professor Vladimir Bodarenko, for their time, thoughtful suggestions and feedback on this work. Your work have greatly influenced my research and your perspectives have enriched this thesis and helped me refine my ideas.

To my colleagues and friends in the department \textemdash\, John Ajayi, Xavier Sodjavi, Sheriff Akeeb, Akinwale Famotire, Emeka Mazi, to mention a few, I say a big thank you for creating a highly simulating and collaborative environment for learning. My sincere gratitude also goes to the faculty members of the Department of Mathematics at Georgia State University, many of whom I have had the honor of learning from. I am particularly thankful to Dr. Zhongshan Li, Professor Alexandra Smirnova, and Professor Mariana Montiel, to mention a few, for their mentorship, expertise, and encouragement throughout my academic journey. Their dedication to teaching and research has been a constant source of inspiration. Additionally, I extend my thanks to the entire staff of the department for their support and assistance, which have been instrumental in creating a conducive environment for learning and research.

Finally, I would like to acknowledge my parents, Mr. and Mrs. Adebesin,\comm{With titles like Mr.\ and Mrs.\ you want to use ``\textbackslash '' (backslash space) instead of just space so it doesn't look like the end of a sentence as it does here.}my siblings and several father and mother figures in my life \textemdash\, Mr. and Mrs. Olawuyi, Mrs. Abioye, Mr. Agboola for their unwavering support.
